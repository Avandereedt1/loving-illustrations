                <h2>First and foremost I am a human being. Plain & Simple</h3>
                    <p>It's easy to get caught up in how other's indenitfy us, especially when we are called to be a shoulder to cry one, a helping hand, an employee, other career indentifications such as police officer, doctor, nurse, and so on. Sometimes we, myself included, forget that we are not super heros. We're still human beings that need what we give of ourselves to others every single day. We're capable of doing great things when we work towards his glory, but we do fall. And we do need to take care of our bodies, minds, and hearts so that we can continue being what is asked of us.</p>

                <h2>Second is dependent on those who I am blessed to call family & friends</h3>
                    <p> I am most definitely an introvert. Throughout the years I have been steadily growing out of my shell, but my circle is still considerably small. I am the youngest daughter of two, the older being my sister named Abigail. So of course, I am a sister as well. Then to my extended family on both sides of my parents, I am a grandaughter, niece, cousin, etc...To my close friends we are as close as blood family, so I am their sister too. To less close friends but still dear to me, simply Amanda. </p>

                <h2>Third I am as stated above, a Catholic Christian</h3>
                    <p>I was born and raised in a Catholic Christian household, far as my immediate family goes. But predomintely the rest of my family also are practicing Christians. So needless to say, I have always had someone to help guide me through life. My own conversion story. Which did not officially start until I was in my early-mid twenties. I believed in God, the holy trinity, the holy family, etc... Went to mass services, ccds classes, baptizied, first communion, and confirmation. By the way my confirmation saint that I chose was the patron saint of writers and artists, ST. Catherine of Bologana.</p>
